# about
It's like Blackjack except instead of playing against the dealer, you're playing against everyone else at the table

# rules
- First to 21 wins
- If not 21 then the player with the highest total without exceeding 21 wins

# etc
To play with a set number of players, append ?x (x being the number) to the end of https://rdmdk.github.io/cards/
