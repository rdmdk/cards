# about
It's like Blackjack except instead of playing against the dealer, you're playing against everyone else at the table

2 - 12 players

# rules
- First to 21 wins
- If not 21 then the player with the highest total without exceeding 21 wins
- There are no ties so if two or more players stand or finish at X and X is the highest total then the high roller (player with the biggest bank) or top-left-most player (whichever comes first) wins
- Each player bets a third of their bank unless they're holding an ace, then they bet half (in multiples of 5)
- Players who bust lose double their bets so stand with pride and conviction, that said...
- Every hit deducts $5 from the player's original bet
- Three 7s results in a Payday where the winner collects every player's bank

## knockout rules
- Same as above, however...
- Each player starts out with $100 and loses $10 with each round lost
- Hit it to win it so unless you have the high score, don't hold back - 21 or bust
- Last standing player wins the jackpot
